#
# Unless you use a custom mechanism to load your configuration (see
# SessionBuilder.withConfigLoader), all the values declared here will be used as defaults. You can
# place your own `application.conf` in the classpath to override them.
#
# Options are classified into two categories:
# - basic: what is most likely to be customized first when kickstarting a new application.
# - advanced: more elaborate tuning options, or &quot;expert&quot;-level customizations.
#
# This file is in HOCON format, see https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md.
datastax-java-driver {

  # BASIC OPTIONS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # The contact points to use for the initial connection to the cluster.
  #
  # These are addresses of Cassandra nodes that the driver uses to discover the cluster topology.
  # Only one contact point is required (the driver will retrieve the address of the other nodes
  # automatically), but it is usually a good idea to provide more than one contact point, because if
  # that single contact point is unavailable, the driver cannot initialize itself correctly.
  #
  # This must be a list of strings with each contact point specified as &quot;host:port&quot;. If the host is
  # a DNS name that resolves to multiple A-records, all the corresponding addresses will be used. Do
  # not use &quot;localhost&quot; as the host name (since it resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on some
  # platforms).
  #
  # Note that Cassandra 3 and below requires all nodes in a cluster to share the same port (see
  # CASSANDRA-7544).
  #
  # Contact points can also be provided programmatically when you build a cluster instance. If both
  # are specified, they will be merged. If both are absent, the driver will default to
  # 127.0.0.1:9042.
  #
  # Required: no
  # Modifiable at runtime: no
  # Overridable in a profile: no
  // basic.contact-points = [ &quot;127.0.0.1:9042&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.2:9042&quot; ]

  # A name that uniquely identifies the driver instance created from this configuration. This is
  # used as a prefix for log messages and metrics.
  #
  # If this option is absent, the driver will generate an identifier composed of the letter &#39;s&#39;
  # followed by an incrementing counter. If you provide a different value, try to keep it short to
  # keep the logs readable. Also, make sure it is unique: reusing the same value will not break the
  # driver, but it will mix up the logs and metrics.
  #
  # Required: no
  # Modifiable at runtime: no
  # Overridable in a profile: no
  // basic.session-name = my_session

  # The name of the keyspace that the session should initially be connected to.
  #
  # This expects the same format as in a CQL query: case-sensitive names must be quoted (note that
  # the quotes must be escaped in HOCON format). For example:
  #    session-keyspace = case_insensitive_name
  #    session-keyspace = \&quot;CaseSensitiveName\&quot;
  #
  # If this option is absent, the session won&#39;t be connected to any keyspace, and you&#39;ll have to
  # either qualify table names in your queries, or use the per-query keyspace feature available in
  # Cassandra 4 and above (see Request.getKeyspace()).
  #
  # This can also be provided programatically in CqlSessionBuilder.
  #
  # Required: no
  # Modifiable at runtime: no
  # Overridable in a profile: no
  // basic.session-keyspace = my_keyspace

  # How often the driver tries to reload the configuration.
  #
  # To disable periodic reloading, set this to 0.
  #
  # Required: yes (unless you pass a different ConfigLoader to the session builder).
  # Modifiable at runtime: yes, the new value will be used after the next time the configuration
  #   gets reloaded.
  # Overridable in a profile: no
  basic.config-reload-interval = 5 minutes

  basic.request {
    # How long the driver waits for a request to complete. This is a global limit on the duration of
    # a session.execute() call, including any internal retries the driver might do.
    #
    # By default, this value is set pretty high to ensure that DDL queries don&#39;t time out, in order
    # to provide the best experience for new users trying the driver with the out-of-the-box
    # configuration.
    # For any serious deployment, we recommend that you use separate configuration profiles for DDL
    # and DML; you can then set the DML timeout much lower (down to a few milliseconds if needed).
    #
    # Note that, because timeouts are scheduled on the driver&#39;s timer thread, the duration specified
    # here must be greater than the timer tick duration defined by the
    # advanced.netty.timer.tick-duration setting (see below). If that is not the case, timeouts will
    # not be triggered as timely as desired.
    #
    # Required: yes
    # Modifiable at runtime: yes, the new value will be used for requests issued after the change.
    # Overridable in a profile: yes
    timeout = 2 seconds

    # The consistency level.
    #
    # Required: yes
    # Modifiable at runtime: yes, the new value will be used for requests issued after the change.
    # Overridable in a profile: yes
    consistency = LOCAL_ONE

    # The page size. This controls how many rows will be retrieved simultaneously in a single
    # network roundtrip (the goal being to avoid loading too many results in memory at the same
    # time). If there are more results, additional requests will be used to retrieve them (either
    # automatically if you iterate with the sync API, or explicitly with the async API&#39;s
    # fetchNextPage method).
    # If the value is 0 or negative, it will be ignored and the request will not be paged.
    #
    # Required: yes
    # Modifiable at runtime: yes, the new value will be used for requests issued after the change.
    # Overridable in a profile: yes
    page-size = 5000

    # The serial consistency level.

    # - com.datastax.dse.driver.internal.core.loadbalancing.
    #
    # The driver provides three implementations out of the box:
    #
    # - `DefaultLoadBalancingPolicy`: should almost always be used; it requires a local datacenter
    #   to be specified either programmatically when creating the session, or via the configuration
    #   option: datastax-java-driver.basic.load-balancing-policy.local-datacenter. It can also
    #   use a highly efficient slow replica avoidance mechanism, which is by default enabled – see
    #   the option: datastax-java-driver.basic.load-balancing-policy.slow-replica-avoidance.
    # - `DcInferringLoadBalancingPolicy`: similar to `DefaultLoadBalancingPolicy`, but does not
    #   require a local datacenter to be defined, in which case it will attempt to infer the local
    #   datacenter from the provided contact points, if possible; if that fails, it will throw an
    #   error during session initialization. This policy is intended mostly for ETL tools and
    #   should not be used by normal applications.
    # - `BasicLoadBalancingPolicy`: similar to `DefaultLoadBalancingPolicy`, but does not have
    #   the slow replica avoidance mechanism. More importantly, it is the only policy capable of
    #   operating without local datacenter defined, in which case it will consider nodes in the
    #   cluster in a datacenter-agnostic way. Beware that this could cause spikes in
    #   cross-datacenter traffic! This policy is provided mostly as a starting point for users
    #   wishing to implement their own load balancing policy; it should not be used as is in normal
    #   applications.
    #
    # You can also specify a custom class that implements LoadBalancingPolicy and has a public
    # constructor with two arguments: the DriverContext and a String representing the profile name.

    # points: in that case, the driver defaults to 127.0.0.1:9042, and that node&#39;s datacenter is
    # used as the local datacenter. As soon as you provide contact points (either through the
    # configuration or through the session builder), you must define the local datacenter
    # explicitly, and initialization will fail if this property is absent. In addition, all contact
    # points should be from this datacenter; warnings will be logged for nodes that are from a
    # different one.

    # - com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.auth
    # - com.datastax.dse.driver.internal.core.auth
    #
    # The driver provides two implementations:
    # - PlainTextAuthProvider: uses plain-text credentials. It requires the `username` and
    #   `password` options below. When connecting to Datastax Enterprise, an optional
    #   `authorization-id` can also be specified.
    #   For backward compatibility with previous driver versions, you can also use the class name
    #   &quot;DsePlainTextAuthProvider&quot; for this provider.
    # - DseGssApiAuthProvider: provides GSSAPI authentication for DSE clusters secured with
    #   DseAuthenticator. See the example below and refer to the manual for detailed instructions.
    #
    # You can also specify a custom class that implements AuthProvider and has a public constructor
    # with a DriverContext argument (to simplify this, the driver provides two abstract classes that
    # can be extended: PlainTextAuthProviderBase and DseGssApiAuthProviderBase).

    # DseSessionBuilder#withAuthProvider. In that case, it will take precedence over the

    # this option to &quot;cassandra&quot;. If this value is not explicitly set via configuration (in an
    # application.conf or programmatically), the driver will attempt to set it via a System
    # property. The property should be &quot;dse.sasl.service&quot;. For backwards compatibility with 1.x
    # versions of the driver, if &quot;dse.sasl.service&quot; is not set as a System property, the driver will
